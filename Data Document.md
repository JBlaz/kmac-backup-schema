## Data Descriptions

KMAC Data stored in SharePoint and QuickBooks is described as follows.

#### SharePoint

SharePoint will have documents such as Lease Agreements, Tax Documents, Valuations, etc. *Migration Note* This will be what was on E, F, & G drives. These will be renamed and organized slightly differently according to SharePoint storage practices.

#### QuickBooks Online

QuickBooks will store bookkeeping documents (what was on the Q drive).

## Data Access

Data will be accessed primarily through SharePoint and QuickBooks Online. SharePoint can be accessed through a web browser, desktop apps, mobile apps, or network drive.

#### Accessing backup data

SharePoint and QuickBooks online both have implementations of version history and backups. These will be the easiest ways to access old versions of files in any event. In more catastrophic cases the following options are also available

#### Synology

Data will be available first from the Synology Server Backup. This can be accessed through this link (A LINK WILL BE PROVIDED WHEN THE DATA IS ACTUALLY BACKED UP THIS WAY).

#### Physical Backup

If all others fail to produce the copy of the data you need then give olâ€™ Joe a call and we can dust off the hard drive in his basement.
